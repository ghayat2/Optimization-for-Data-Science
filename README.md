# Optimization-for-Data-Science - 8ETCS Spring Course- ETH Zürich

This assignment was about testing whether a set of d- dimensional balls have a common intersection point.
We analysed the running time of different algorithms to solve the  ε-intersection.
Given ε > 0 and a collection of d-dimensional balls represented by their centers and radii, compute either a point **x** such that h(**x**) < ε, or show that for every **x**
, it holds that h(**x**) > 0. 

The instructions of the assignment are included in the repository.
